We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\np\nidentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\nsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\nthinking around with our re-phrasing).\n\nI hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

Walker professorship and keynote request\n\n\nThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\n\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\nother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\n\nA few points of elaboration:\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\npositions.\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\napproval.\n     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October\n13.\n\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\n\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\n\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\n\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\nwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\n\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n","to":["walker@missouri.edu"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-09-08 07:02:00-07:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: P.

This will be separate from the utilities' \nstrategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes \ntax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as \ncontributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to \npaid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth \nEdison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. \n2944).\n\nSenator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA \namendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed \nto the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've \nreviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the \nconcept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was \nSenator Kerrey's idea.  \n\nIt is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) \nwould still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact \nthat Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the \nDemocrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not \nhe is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive \nelectricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least \nthree years away from happening.\"\n\nSteve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position \non this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to \noppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like \nSouthern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the \nMidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access \nprovisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n\n\n\n\n","to":["cynthia.sandherr@enron.com"],"bcc":["steven.kean@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","james.steffes@enron.com","joe.hillings@enron.com","tom.briggs@enron.com","joe.hartsoe@enron.com","sarah.novosel@enron.com","dwatkiss@bracepatt.com","awenner@velaw.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-09-10 23:23:00-07:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["rahm@missouri.edu"],"cc":[],"text":"OOps, I can't seem to open it!!\n\n\n\n\n\"Rahm, Charles E.\" <Rahm@missouri.edu> on 09/11/2000 08:58:56 AM\nTo: \"'Kenneth Lay'\" <kenneth.lay@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Bio for Davenport Program\n\n\nDr. Lay:\n\nWe need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J.

Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.\nPlease, remember to vote and go early, polls open at\n7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put\nit off until 7pm as there could be lines and the\nsupervisors are not required to keep the polls open\nafter 7pm for those in line.\nRemind your friends and family to vote and if someone\nneeds transportation to the polls, give them a ride or\ncall your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or\nyour local Democratic campaign office, they will have\npeople available to transport people to the polls.\nKeep an eye out while you are at the polls for\nelectoral fraud and report any suspicious activity\nincluding inappropriate campaigning to the poll\nwatchers at the polls. The Democrats and the\nRepublicans will have representatives at most of the\npolls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.\nFinally, if you have time, call your local offices and\noffer your time to make phone calls to encourage\npeople to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to\nbe available to help prevent of voter fraud.\n\nFinally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come\nin. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!\n\nJust one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's\nfrom me and everyone else)!\nTake care and VOTE!\nLiz\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nThousands of Stores.

About an hour ago, I held a news\nconference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make\nsure you were able to read it in its entirety.\n\nYou are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my\nadministration.

For more information on\nthe Katz administration, visit our website at\nhttp://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.\n\n\nStatement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker\n\n\"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have\nreviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me\nfeedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.\n\n\"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests\nwith me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the\ntaped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no\nway reflect my own personal beliefs.\n\n\"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and\ntranscripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this\nissue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious\nviews from his professional conduct?\n\n\"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue\nto do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau\nin a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law\nenforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I\nhave asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong\nsupport to continue.\n\n\"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal\nreligious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status\nif their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability\nto perform their professional responsibilities.\n\n\"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he\nis \"out of step with Portland\" could be used in other Oregon communities to\nfire more liberal public officials who are \"out of step\" with their\ncommunity's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both\nways.\n\n\"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He\nassures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo\nthe damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than\njust walk away.\n\n\"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who\nare gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.\nHe has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.\n\n\"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of\nall Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.\n\n\"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson\nto educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a \"gay disease.\"\n\n\"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual\nMinority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.\n\n\"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.\n\n\"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will\nwork to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our\nsense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's\npersonal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and\nto deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.\n\n\"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\n\n","to":["mayorkatz@ci.portland.or.us"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-11-09 20:31:00-08:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["gary.fitch@enron.com","anna.harris@enron.com","kristi.kraemer@enron.com","anna.harris@enron.com","kristi.kraemer@enron.com"],"cc":["anna.harris@enron.com","kristi.kraemer@enron.com"],"text":"Gary, every time Ken tells me to report it, I tell Anna or Kristi and they, \nin turn, pass it on to whoever they deal with in Maintenance.

On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill \nReddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it \ndisconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported \nthis problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.

Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\n\n\nDick\n\n\n\n","to":["kevin.hannon@enron.com"],"bcc":["sherri.sera@enron.com","carol.brown@enron.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-12-11 06:39:00-08:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: Cornell"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["kelly.merritt@enron.com"],"cc":[],"text":"Dear Kelly:\n\nI appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\n\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\n\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\n a=20\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\nhe=20\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\n=20\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\ne=20\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\nf=20\ndistributed generation.\n=20\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\n\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\na=20\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\n=20\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).

Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.

I can only say that it\nwas a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked\non the planning!\nNow to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and\nregatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.\nHowever the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,\nthe cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted\n$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per\nperson.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows\nfor the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that\nsailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then\nleaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for\n$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.\nIn the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than\nexpected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by\nthe end of next week.\nThe most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00\nor do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of\ncourse, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a\ncancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?\nI am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will\nbe here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything\nfinalized before she leaves.\nGive us your thoughts.\n\nThe EX-MC Director\nSharon\n\n","to":["sharon@travelpark.com"],"bcc":["jhduncan@aol.com","janelle@travelpark.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-01-17 09:35:00-08:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: Final items of the MC"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["nicholap@asiasoc.org","robertr@asiasoc.org","dorothy.barnes@enron.com","robertr@asiasoc.org","dorothy.barnes@enron.com"],"cc":["robertr@asiasoc.org","dorothy.barnes@enron.com"],"text":"Mr. Platt -\n\nKen Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of \nthe five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14.

As a result oil prices pushed\nslightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at\n25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl\nas a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as\nfollows:\n\nAlgeria - 32,000\nIndonesia - 52,000\nIran - 146,000\nKuwait - 80,000\nLibya - 54,000\nNigeria - 82,000\nQatar - 26,000\nSaudi Arabia - 324,000\nUAE - 88,000\nVenezuela - 116,000\nTotal - 1,000,000\n\n\nENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\n(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\nexploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\nOffshore area.\nEnergy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\n(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy\nAfrica's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\nAndrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore\nwhich make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\nvery much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the\nmoment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum\nBulletin.\n\n\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\nLondon - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\nexploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies\ncurrently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the\ncompany.\n\n\nAHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC\nTripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed\nhas been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he\nhad been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC\nconference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as\nDeputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign\ninvestors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow\nratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of\nblocks offered by NOC in late 2000.\n\n\n\n*******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001******\n\nThe MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for\nthe top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\n\nAnne Culver\nSr. VP, Government Relations\nGreater Houston Partnership\n713/844-3624 (ph)\n713/844-0224 (fax)\naculver@houston.org\n\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\n\n\n","to":["aculver@houston.org"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2001-03-26 02:25:00-08:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional\r\n infor\tmation"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["alliancetosaveenergy@ase.org"],"cc":[],"text":"AlliancetoSaveEnergy@ase.org@crest.org on 03/26/2001 11:52:38 AM\nSent by: owner-e-fficiencynews@crest.org\nTo: e-fficiencynews@lists.ase.org\ncc: =20\nSubject: March e-FFICIENCY NEWS\n\n\nWELCOME TO e-FFICIENCY NEWS\n\nThe monthly newsletter from the\nAlliance to Save Energy\n\nFebruary 2001 Vol. 7 No. 3\n\n\n********************************\n\nCONTENTS\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP\n* How Can We Better Meet Your Needs?\n* CALL TO ACTION\n* Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference\n* EFFICIENCY NEWS\n* Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill\n* Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places\n* Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget\n* Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship\n* Financial Guru to Investors: Insulate; NAIMA Debuts New Consumer Web\nSite\n* IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change\n* Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations\n* State of the World Report\n* List Your Company in Two New CA Directories\n* Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code\n* Alliance Associates Honored with Awards\n* ALLIANCE NEWS\n* Alliance Offers Earth Day, Tax, Home Improvement Tips to Save Money\n* Special Issue of e-FFICIENCY NEWS to Analyze Federal Budget\n* EYE OPENERS\n* Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand\n* Schools Spending on Energy\n* Save the Planet, Spare Your Wallet\n* EFFICIENCY EVENTS\n* Change in Location for National Energy Modeling System/Annual Energy\nOutlook Conference March 27\n* NAESCO=01,s 2001 Mid-Year Conference May 22-24\n* Peak Load Management Conference April 30-May 1\n* Environmental Film Festival April 5-8\n* Energy Efficiency Workshop, Exposition June 3-6\n* Pacific Gas and Electric RFP\n* EFFICIENCY PEOPLE\n* Energy Job Openings\n\n\n********************************\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP\n\nHow Can We Better Meet Your Needs?\n\nThis year, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has a new editor and a new production schedule.\nFirst, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has upgraded from a bimonthly to a monthly\nnewsletter.

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,\ntransportation, and industry could account for more than half of the\npotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas\ntechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=\nd\npower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant\nemissions. And \"low-carbon energy systems,\" such as renewable energy, can\nalso make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the\nfinding that there is \"no single path to a low emission future.\"\n\nRead more:\nwww.unep.ch/ipcc/ <http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBarriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations\n\nThere is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-\nefficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually\nseen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy\nresearch group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a\nseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden\ncosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from\noperating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of\nthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through\nimproved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=\nd\nin the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=\ne\ndevelopment of a broadly based energy service industry.\n\nRead more:\nwww.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html\n<http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nState of the World Report\n\nFrom the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the\nmosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the\nWorld 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged\nnatural systems.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\nthan are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code\nis the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\nTexas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new\nstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\ng\nenergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\nserve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=\ne\nTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG\nstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=\ne\nProject and Alliance Associates.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlliance Associates Honored with Awards\n\nMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards\nCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the\nDepartment of Energy.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area\non\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and\nadvise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before\nor\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\nto\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\na\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.

Total net loss for 2001  was \nprojected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  \ncontinues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  \nancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  \nor?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  \nresources are \"more than adequate\" to get the business profitable.? The  \ncompany has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  \nflexibility.  \nThe company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  \nactive subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  \ntoday and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  \n2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  \nfees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  \nbetween $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription \nand  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the \nsoft  Internet advertising markets.  \nJuno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  \ncovering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  \nTime Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  \nMetricom (wireless).  \nThe company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  \nMobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be \nforthcoming.  \nThe company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  \ncompetitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  \npublicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  \nopportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  \ndomestically and internationally.?  \nThe Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's \nefforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing \ninitiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs \nof subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and \ncomputational chemistry firms.? \nhttp://www.juno.com/corp/news/supercomputer.html\n\n\n=============\nToby  Bryce\n(347) 200-0882\nbryce@juno.com\n=============\n?\nOn Wed, 14 Mar 2001 16:52:52 -0500 Toby Bryce <bryce@juno.com> writes:\n> Mr.  Lay,\n> \n> I am contacting you (per instructions of Rosalee) with a  director \n> opportunity with a NASDAQ-listed Internet media firm.?

Len Baker may feel that the\nlanguage on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.

(Most of the group feels this\napproach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also\nfeels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating\nwhat companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to\nwrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of\nyou will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you\nfeel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do\nstate them for the record.\n\n  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,\netc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you\nletting me know if you can sign-off on the report.

As discussed, he is to chair the first of\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\nThe panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\nSciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\n\nAs I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\nresponsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive\nissues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\nI would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\nkeep our files current.\n\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\ndocuments to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\nif you had any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\n\nIn addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\nduring our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also\nplanning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\ncoming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\nany events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\n\nAlso, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\nmight facilitate their logistics.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJonathan Pershing\n\n________________________\nJonathan C.

The proposal should be well received as the \nCommittiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation \nto minority money managers.

Lay\nChairman\nEnron\n\n\nDear Dr Lay,\n\nWhen the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the\n2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious\n\"dream budget\" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key\nsectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost\nto the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was\nwelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business\ncommunity.\n\nOn the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership\nwith the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New\nDelhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and\nextensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been\nimplemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic\nindustry activity and foreign investment.\n\nAs we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I\nwould like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and\nunderstanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you\nany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the\nagenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have\nwould also be welcomed.\n\nI look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and\nkindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:\nmitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).\n\nFor more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the\nwebsite of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in\nIndia again next December.\n\nBest regards,\n\nColette Mathur,\nDirector,\nCenter for Regional Strategies\nWorld Economic Forum\n\n\n","to":["indiasummit@weforum.org"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2001-04-30 23:17:00-07:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["john.lavorato@enron.com"],"cc":[],"text":"John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer.\n\nRosie\n\n\nFrom: John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate@enronXgate on 04/30/2001 11:30 AM\nSent by: Kimberly Hillis/ENRON@enronXgate\nTo: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Joannie \nWilliamson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cliff Baxter/ENRON@enronXgate, James A \nHughes/ENRON@enronXgate, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Mike \nMcConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rebecca McDonald/ENRON@enronXgate, Mark \nMetts/Enron@EnronXGate, Stephanie Harris/ENRON@enronXgate, Maureen \nMcVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Loretta Brelsford/ENRON@enronXgate, Dolores \nFisher/Enron@EnronXGate, Sherri Sera/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jana L \nPaxton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Connie \nBlackwood/ENRON@enronXgate, Mrudula \nGadade/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Cliff Baxter/ENRON@enronXgate, \nMark Frevert/ENRON@enronXgate, Nicki Daw/ENRON@enronXgate, Lucy \nMarshall/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kathy \nMcMahon/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Philippe A \nBibi/ENRON@enronXgate, Raymond Bowen/ENRON@enronXgate, Michael R \nBrown/LON/ECT@ECT, Harold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Rick Buy/ENRON@enronXgate, \nRichard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Cox/Enron Communications@Enron \nCommunications, David W Delainey/HOU/EES@EES, James Derrick/ENRON@enronXgate, \nSteve Elliott/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Andrew S \nFastow/ENRON@enronXgate, Ben Glisan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin Hannon/Enron \nCommunications@Enron Communications, Rod Hayslett/ENRON@enronXgate, Stanley \nHorton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark \nKoenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, \nDanny McCarty/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey McMahon/ENRON@enronXgate, Mark S \nMuller/HOU/EES@EES, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lou L Pai/HOU/EES@EES, Ken \nRice/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Matthew \nScrimshaw/LON/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/ENRON@enronXgate, Jeffrey \nSherrick/ENRON@enronXgate, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Jeff \nSkilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nThomas E White/HOU/EES@EES, G G Garcia/ENRON@enronXgate, Susan \nSkarness/ENRON@enronXgate, Karen K Heathman/ENRON@enronXgate, Sharron \nWestbrook/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kay Chapman/HOU/EES@EES, Bridget \nMaronge/ENRON@enronXgate, Inez Dauterive/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol Ann Brown/Enron \nCommunications@Enron Communications, Cindy Stark/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rosalee \nFleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tori L Wells/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cathy \nPhillips/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sue Ford/ENRON@enronXgate, Karen Owens/HOU/EES@EES, \nDorothy Dalton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Mercedes \nEstrada/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Christina \nGrow/ENRON@enronXgate, Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT, Laura \nTaylor/ENRON@enronxgate, Judy G Smith/HOU/EES@EES, Suzanne \nDanz/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Peggy McCurley/ENRON@enronXgate, Marsha \nSchiller/ENRON@enronXgate, Tammie Schoppe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kimberly \nHillis/ENRON@enronXgate, Jennifer Burns/ENRON@enronXgate, Sharon \nDick/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly Aden/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Leah \nRijo/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kathy \nCampos/ENRON@enronXgate, Julie Armstrong/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kelly \nJohnson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rebecca Carter/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: VP Candidate Greg Shea\n\nI would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive \nCommittee meeting on May 7, 2001.

dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the \nfairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, \nthe National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff \nSkilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.\n\nEnron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over \n350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the \nEnron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am \nchallenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain \namount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a \nbreak on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's \ncloser to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat \npledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge \nto this very worthy cause 1-1.\n\nI hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top \nmoney raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your \nconsideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.\n\nSherri x3-5984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","to":["sherri.sera@enron.com"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-04-03 08:45:00-07:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: Jeff Skilling does MS150"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["jonathan.pershing@iea.org"],"cc":[],"text":"I think we've received everything Mr. Pershing.

The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented\nby one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action\nlawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a\nnominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.\n\nWhat makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff\nshareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on\nbehalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is\nclaiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that\nall damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff\ncan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\nDerivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\n\nThe Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\non your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm\ntry and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate\ntime, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you\nwould like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common\npractice.\n\nI will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.

Awareness of Environmental Issue\n1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of\nnatural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.\nThe impact on the business is becoming to increase.\n2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework\nfor dealing with the issue of global warming.\n(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%\nfor Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)\nSpecific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism\n(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),\nand Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,\nwhich is scheduled for November 2000.\n     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.\n\n2. GHG Reduction\n1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change\nremains uncertain at present and further research is required.\nPolicies will have to be devised that take account of developments\nin scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains\nflexibility.\n2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of\neach country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,\neconomic measures and voluntary measures.\n     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business\ncompetition.\n\n3. Energy Conservation\n1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a\nlarge, mobile country, much\nconsumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.\n2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,\nand has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.\n\n3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy\nconservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.\nAs a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,\nand has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.\nJapan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.\nIndustry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental\nplans and other measures.\nJapanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy\nconsumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at\ntheir factories.\n\n4. Programme of Industry\n1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of\nproducts and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing\ncost saving in the long run.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n(See attached file: Einvironmentalissue0118.doc)\n\n   Hitoshi Misaki, Group Manager\n   Relations-Group,\n   International Division TOSHIBA CORPORATION\n   1-1,Shibaura 1-chome Minatoku Tokyo\n   JAPAN 105-8001\n   TEL:03-3457-3661, FAX:03-5444-9217\n   e-mail:hitoshi misaki@toshiba.co.jp\n   YES T can !\n\n - Einvironmentalissue0118.doc\n\n","to":["hitoshi.misaki@toshiba.co.jp"],"bcc":["browne_ejp@bp.com","aknittel@ford.com","daniel.esty@yale.edu","forma@gol.com","masae.oobayashi@dx.toshiba.co.jp","yasuo3.uchida@dx.toshiba.co.jp","kiyoharu.yokoyama@dx.toshiba.co.jp","naoki1.kubo@dx.toshiba.co.jp","tomoko.seki@dx.toshiba.co.jp","yasuhiro2.shimura@dx.toshiba.co.jp"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-01-18 01:50:00-08:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"Re: WEF- Outline of Opinion for Environmental Agenda"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["jeffrey.mcclellan@enron.com"],"cc":[],"text":"Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.

Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your \ninteroffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you \nwill not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is \nquite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by \nknowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it \npossible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as \nsuch?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an \nincreased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with \nwhich to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.\n\nAs we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional \"brown \nbags\" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  \nI believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image \ncampaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could \nmake it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you \nthe date when I have it.\n\nChet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on \nSept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will \nhave a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it \nwill be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your \ncalendar is free.\n\nI am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your \napproachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all \nor even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are \ndoing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.\n\nThank you for your time,\nJeff\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffrey McClellan/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 \n02:48 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nJeffrey McClellan\n04/12/2000 05:10 PM\nTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: Cougars @ Enron\n\nMr. Lay,\nMy name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the \"Cougars @ Enron\".  We \nare a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together \nto form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our \nkickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and \nhave received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you \na line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of \ntoday, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to \nour group's success. We have several stated objectives:\n\n1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  \nThis will benefit the employees as well as the company.\n2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the \nUniversity of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.\n3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.\n4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.\n\nCurrently, here is what we have planned:\n\n4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at \"Frontier Fiesta\".   Frontier \nFiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good \nfamily   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.\n\n9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first \nhome football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up \na   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We \nwould like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The \nuniversity will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision \nScoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.\n\nThese are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  \nWe anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would \nlike the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to \nits members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be \none of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we \nneed to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an \nalumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would \nyou consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your \nparticipation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish \nour goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most \ndistinguished alumni.

(NASDAQ: INTU\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\n> the board.\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among\n> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\n> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of\n> businesses.\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\n> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.\n> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an\n> ideal match for our future.\"\n> Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced\n> and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management\n> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad\n> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,\n> \"Steve shares Intuit's values. He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,\n> results-driven executive who cares deeply about people. His\n> values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations to great\n> achievement, and I look forward to working with him.\"\n>\n>\n>  -----Original Message-----\n>  From: Marino, Richard [mailto:Richard_Marino@intuit.com]\n>  Sent: Monday, April 24, 2000 8:01 PM\n>  To: Oakes, Bob; 'Janice.Farnow@avnet.com'; Velijanian, Fred\n>  Cc: Bell, Lance; Pan, Andrew\n>  Subject: High Availability Server Evaluation Results\n>\n>\n>  We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for\n> their\n>  efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess.

This session has no  bullet points as I wou=\nld=20\nlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit.

The confere=\nnce=20\nwill be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20\nchance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=\nl=20\nbe partitioned into five areas:=20\n\n1) Information technology for risk management\n\n2) Information technology for pricing and trading\n\n3) Data techniques and strategies\n\n4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management\n\n5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace\n\nEach of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=\n=20\nby energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=\n a=20\ncopy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20\nexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=\n=20\nproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\n\nThis conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=\ne=20\nto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=\n=20\nfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=\n=20\nhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=\n=20\nme know; any help would be gratefully received.\n\nThis event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20\nManagement Magazine and our extensive database.

Totally unexpected & \nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good \nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, \nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific \nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \nmodify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \nfind another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \navoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \nthis.\"  \n\nTo date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \nEnron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \nand there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \nCindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was \ndecided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when \nthings go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented \nprofessional more time.  She writes:\n\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in \nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 \ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received \nanswers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without \nacknowledgment of any sort.\n\nI have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened \nto them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 \nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...\n\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There \nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & \ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from \nHR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line \nwith Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  \n\nCindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \nhonor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \nmention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to \nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not \nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I \nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  \"believing your own \nbaloney.\"  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but \"believing \nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked \nfor candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.\n\nJeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening \ntoo, but seeing is believing.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBetty Alexander\nSr. Administrative Assistant \n","to":["sarah.davis@enron.com"],"bcc":["sherri.sera@enron.com","joseph.sutton@enron.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-07-10 00:59:00-07:00","folder":"_sent","subject":"OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron..."},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["ceoextra@houston.org"],"cc":[],"text":"Ken Lay will be there.

Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual \nBeach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, \nraising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the \nfundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will \nbe used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nI have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel \nMcPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in \nthis cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but \nI want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.\n\nI am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  \nChecks are payable to MDA.\n\nFYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. \n\nThe event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks!

Glenn will be in touch as the project\nunfolds.\n\nNow I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,\n2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.\n\nFirst, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken\nInstitute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in\nLos Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have\na heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and\ntechnology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we\nhave nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other\nheavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this\nyear's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some\nrepresentation from Enron in the audience.\n\nSecond, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have\nattached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the\nvarious levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.\nThis is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers\nand a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on\nyour organization for support.\n\nWe anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial\nsector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the\nmajor media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a\nsignificant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking\non key business, economic, financial and policy questions.\n\nI hope we can count on you.\n\nRegards,\n\nDonald H.

Wondered if you have had a\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\nis well with you.\n\n\n            Nov.2 email text\n\n\nWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\nbeyond.\n\n\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\nspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\n2001</underline>.\n\n\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\nPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \n\n\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\n\n\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\nthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \n\n\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\npractices make this possible.\n\n\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\nway.\n\n\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.

He is now semi-retired following a very successful business\ncareer.  He remains a special advisor to the chairman of Merrill Lynch &\nCo., Inc., in New York.  Previously, he was executive VP and global director\nof all debt markets underwriting, sales, and trading for the firm.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Roger has been actively involved with MU,\nspecifically with the College of Business.  He has served as chair of both\nthe Strategic Development Board and the Davenport Society.  Roger also was a\nmember of the steering committee for the college's very successful capital\ncampaign.  I hold him in the highest regard and feel fortunate that he, like\nyou, has chosen to contribute to his undergraduate alma mater in various\nsignificant ways.\n\nI hope you will consider the opportunity described in Roger's letter.

We provide you with updates of the Institute's \ncurrent research publications, events and media programs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:\n1. Pentagon \"Shocked\" to Find Rivers Dammed with Pork\n2. The Environmental Propaganda Agency\n3. William Lloyd Garrison, Antislavery Crusader\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPENTAGON \"SHOCKED\" TO FIND RIVERS DAMMED WITH PORK\n\nCaptain Louis Renault -- Claude Raines's cheerfully duplicitous character in \nthe 1942 film classic \"Casablanca\" -- asserted glibly that he was \"shocked, \nshocked\" to learn that gambling was taking place at Rick's Cafe. Moments \nlater he was only too happy to collect his gambling earnings for the night.\n\nAll this is by way of preamble to a new Pentagon investigation of fraud in \nmilitary construction. The investigation concluded that three senior Army \nCorps of Engineers officials had, just as one whistle-blowing Corps economist \nhad claimed, engaged in a deceitful campaign to justify what the Washington \nPost called \"a billion-dollar construction binge on the Mississippi and \nIllinois rivers.\"\n\n\"The [Pentagon] investigators concluded that the agency's aggressive efforts \nto expand its budget and missions, as well as its eagerness to please its \ncorporate customers and congressional patrons, have helped 'create an \natmosphere where objectivity in its analyses was placed in jeopardy,'\" the \nPost reports.\n\n\"Even the agency's retired chief economist told them that Corps studies were \noften 'corrupt,' and that several Corps employees cited 'immense pressure' to \ngreen-light questionable projects.\"\n\nBureaucratic boondoggles of such magnitude are certainly newsworthy. But they \nare hardly news. Just as the Soviets derided the failures of previous Five \nYear Plans (only to implement new, equally flawed versions), so it seems that \nevery few years the Pentagon uncovers massive corruption and waste in its own \ncentrally planned fiefdom -- only to present a new Plan that operates under \nthe same bad incentives that encouraged prior malfeasance.\n\nWith corruption and waste seemingly \"taken care of,\" the worst pork-barrel \nspenders in Congress and the military are then let off the hook, only to \nenjoy -- like Casablanca's Renault and Rick -- an amicable toast to the \nbeginnings of a beautiful new friendship.\n\nFor the Washington Post series on the Army Corp of Engineers boondoggle, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-1.html.\n\nFor a summary of the Independent Institute book, ARMS, POLITICS AND THE \nECONOMY: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives, edited by Robert Higgs, see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-2.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPAGANDA AGENCY\n\nWill the neck-to-neck presidential race help reduce -- or intensify -- \npressure for the next president of the United States to score points with \nstatist environmental activists?\n\nExcept on a few controversial issues, a strong case can be made that the \nforty-third President of the United States will wish to portray himself as a \nclose friend of \"the environment.\" President George W. Bush, for example, \nwould face strong pressure to show that he is \"bipartisan\" in his approach to \nenvironmental protection; whereas President Al Gore would likely attempt to \nwin back those who supported Nader and the Greens.\n\nAll the more reason, then, to call attention to the failures of the current \napproach to environmental protection -- especially those emanating from the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or, as economist Craig Marxsen terms \nit, the Environmental Propaganda Agency.\n\nThe EPA sometimes employs the language of cost-benefit analysis to illustrate \nits seemingly tremendous success, but it is known to employ it in a highly \nmisleading manner. The EPA claimed, for example, that its Clean Air Act \nprograms produced, from 1970 to 1990, $22.2 trillion dollars in health \nbenefits at a cost of only $523 billion. But, reports Marxsen in THE \nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, \"[The EPA's] study actually represents a milestone in \nbureaucratic propaganda. Like junk science in the courtroom, the study \nseemingly attempts to obtain the largest possible benefit figure rather than \nto come as close as possible to the truth.\"\n\nIn conclusion, writes Marxsen, \"Without the illusory benefit of all the lives \nsaved, the actual benefits of the Clean Air Act were very modest and probably \ncould have been achieved nearly as well with far less sacrifice. The Clean \nAir Act and its amendments force the EPA to mandate reduction of air \npollution to levels that would have no adverse health effects on even the \nmost sensitive person in the population. The EPA relentlessly presses forward \nin its absurd quest, like a madman setting fire to his house in an insane \ndetermination to eliminate the last of the insects infesting it.\"\n\nFor more information, see \"The Environmental Propaganda Agency,\" by Craig S. \nMarxsen (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Summer 2000), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-3.html.\n\nFor analysis of other EPA programs, see the Independent Institute book, \nCUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants, Environmental Regulation and the Law, \nedited by Richard Stroup and Roger Meiners, at \nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-4.html.\n\nFor Robert Formaini's insightful review of Kip Viscusi's important book, \nRATIONAL RISK POLICY (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter 1999), see\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-5.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Antislavery Crusader\n\n\"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this \nsubject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write with moderation.... I \nwill not equivocate -- I will not excuse -- I will not retreat a single inch \n-- and I will be heard.\"\n     -- William Lloyd Garrison, THE LIBERATOR, January 1, 1831\n\nDecember 12 marks the 195th anniversary of the birth of William Lloyd \nGarrison, a leading figure in the American abolitionist movement. As the late \nhistorian Henry Mayer explained in his National Book Award-Finalist \nbiography, ALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery:\n\n\"William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) is an authentic American hero who, with a \nBiblical prophet's power and a propagandist's skill, forced the nation to \nconfront the most crucial moral issue in its history. For thirty-five years \nhe edited and published a weekly newspaper in Boston, THE LIBERATOR, which \nremains today a sterling and unrivaled example of personal journalism in the \nservice of civic idealism.\n\n\"Although Garrison -- a self-made man with a scanty formal education -- \nconsidered himself 'a New England mechanic' and lived outside the precincts \nof the American intelligentsia, he nonetheless did the hard intellectual work \nof challenging orthodoxy, questioning public policy, and offering a luminous \nvision of a society transformed. He inspired two generations of activists -- \nfemale and male, black and white -- and together they built a social movement \nwhich, like the civil rights movement of our own day, was a collaboration of \nordinary people, stirred by injustice and committed to each other, who \nachieved a social change that conventional wisdom first condemned as wrong \nand then ridiculed as impossible.\"\n\nIndeed, without Garrison's inflammatory but compelling writing, speaking and \norganizing, there might have been no effective American anti-slavery movement \nat all.\n\nFor more on William Lloyd Garrison, read historian Henry Mayer's talk from \nthe Independent Policy Forum, \"The Civil War: Liberty and American Leviathan\" \n(with Jeffrey Rogers Hummel), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-6.html, or hear it in \nRealAudio at http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-7.html.\n\nAlso see Jeffrey Rogers Hummel's review of Henry Mayer's brilliant biography, \nALL ON FIRE: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery (THE \nINDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-48-8.html.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy receiving THE LIGHTHOUSE ... please help us support it.\n\nYour supporting Independent Associate Membership enables us to reach \nthousands of other people.

In early February of\nthis year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for\n\"Technology For All\" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is\nto enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the\ndisadvantaged (\"TFA\").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO\nof Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to\nbe tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers\n(\"CLC's\") where recycled computers and donated software are connected\nover the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that\ndelivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other\ncontent.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we\nare building affiliations that will build them across the country and\neventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates\noperations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,\nwe have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found\nthat major contributors require a tax determination letter.\n\n    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,\nI responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June\n8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national\noffice.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising\nsome additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there\nwere some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The\nfirst question was something like \"What did we mean by disadvantaged?\"\n\n    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going\nand out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their\nconsiderable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in\nAugust I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish\nthis.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part\nto cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your\nadvice would be appreciated.\n\nRegards:\n\nJack Clark","to":["wewerlacy@aol.com"],"bcc":["jvalenti@mpaa.org","jttkyle@jttrotter.com","klay@enron.com","jhduncan@aol.com","pdouglas@salus.net","syeager@fyi-net.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-12-13 09:23:00-08:00","folder":"all_documents","subject":"IRS Tax Determination Letter"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["james.bannantine@enron.com","cliff.baxter@enron.com","sanjay.bhatnagar@enron.com","jeremy.blachman@enron.com","philippe.bibi@enron.com","raymond.bowen@enron.com","michael.brown@enron.com","harold.buchanan@enron.com","rick.buy@enron.com","richard.causey@enron.com","diomedes.christodoulou@enron.com","wade.cline@enron.com","david.cox@enron.com","david.delainey@enron.com","james.derrick@enron.com","steve.elliott@enron.com","jim.fallon@enron.com","andrew.fastow@enron.com","mark.frevert@enron.com","ben.glisan@enron.com","kevin.hannon@enron.com","david.haug@enron.com","rod.hayslett@enron.com","stanley.horton@enron.com","james.hughes@enron.com","larry.izzo@enron.com","steven.kean@enron.com","louise.kitchen@enron.com","mark.koenig@enron.com","kenneth.lay@enron.com","john.lavorato@enron.com","dan.leff@enron.com","danny.mccarty@enron.com","mike.mcconnell@enron.com","rebecca.mcdonald@enron.com","jeffrey.mcmahon@enron.com","mark.metts@enron.com","mark.muller@enron.com","cindy.olson@enron.com","lou.pai@enron.com","ken.rice@enron.com","matthew.scrimshaw@enron.com","jeffrey.shankman@enron.com","jeffrey.sherrick@enron.com","john.sherriff@enron.com","jeff.skilling@enron.com","marty.sunde@enron.com","greg.whalley@enron.com","thomas.white@enron.com","g.garcia@enron.com","marcia.manarin@enron.com","susan.skarness@enron.com","stacy.guidroz@enron.com","beena.pradhan@enron.com","karen.heathman@enron.com","sharron.westbrook@enron.com","kay.chapman@enron.com","molly.bobrow@enron.com","rosane.fabozzi@enron.com","stephanie.harris@enron.com","bridget.maronge@enron.com","nicki.daw@enron.com","inez.dauterive@enron.com","carol.brown@enron.com","elaine.rodriguez@enron.com","cindy.stark@enron.com","mary.garza@enron.com","maureen.mcvicker@enron.com","joannie.williamson@enron.com","vanessa.groscrand@enron.com","suzanne.danz@enron.com","tori.wells@enron.com","cathy.phillips@enron.com","loretta.brelsford@enron.com","sue.ford@enron.com","dolores.fisher@enron.com","kathy.mcmahon@enron.com","karen.owens@enron.com","dorothy.dalton@enron.com","mercedes.estrada@enron.com","christina.grow@enron.com","lauren.urquhart@enron.com","sherri.sera@enron.com","katherine.brown@enron.com","liz.taylor@enron.com","judy.smith@enron.com","peggy.mccurley@enron.com","marsha.schiller@enron.com","fiona.stewart@enron.com","jana.paxton@enron.com","connie.blackwood@enron.com","tammie.schoppe@enron.com","kimberly.hillis@enron.com","jennifer.burns@enron.com","sharon.dick@enron.com","beverly.aden@enron.com","kathy.dodgen@enron.com","kerry.ferrari@enron.com","carol.moffett@enron.com","jennifer.adams@enron.com","leah.rijo@enron.com","lucy.marshall@enron.com","kathy.campos@enron.com","julie.armstrong@enron.com","kathryn.greer@enron.com","mrudula.gadade@enron.com","brenda.castillo@enron.com"],"cc":[],"text":"---------------------- Forwarded by Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron on 12/13/2000 \n05:59 PM ---------------------------\n\nKathy Mayfield\n12/13/2000 05:02 PM\n\n\nTo: Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: Thank you for the Charitygift\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kathy Mayfield/Corp/Enron on 12/13/2000 \n04:38 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nbill_morgan@kindermorgan.com on 12/13/2000 04:34:58 PM\nTo: kathy.mayfield@enron.com\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Thank you for the Charitygift\n\n\nThank you for the Charity Gift Card.

It always means that\nthere is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the\napplication.\n\n    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is\nestablish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents\nfor determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such\nstandards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive\nthe benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being\nadhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as\nsimple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the\nArticles of Incorporation.\n\n    Last year, our office was brought in at the \"national office\" stage, well\nafter the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in\nWyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain\ntrade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying\nto deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant\npotentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).\nWhat we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client's\nlawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked\nthrough the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had\nidentified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief\naddressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes\nto the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental\napplication information, were enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,\nand they issued the tax determination letter.\n\n    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the\nnational office agent or \"team\" reviewing the application, and get them to\nidentify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a\nperiod of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate\ndocuments would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that\nif you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything\nyou do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you\nhave already received.\n\n    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure\nin triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal\nFoundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did\na Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to\nindicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from\nCongressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its\ndecisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very\ncareful about not creating an impression that they respond to political\npressure.\n\n    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with\nthe national office, we'd be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to\nreview the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney\nfor us to join the team.\n\n    Hope this is helpful.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJim Lacy\nWewer & Lacy, LLP\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this communication and\nany\naccompanying document(s) is protected by the attorney-client and/or the\nattorney/work product privileges.

In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\n=20\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\n=20\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\ne=20\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\n\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\n or=20\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\nd=20\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\ngeneration faces. =20\n\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\n=20\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\n=20\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\nities.=20\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\n=20\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\n. =20\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\n\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\n=20\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\n\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\n=20\nsuppliers.\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\ne=20\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\n=20\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\nredit=20\nrisk concerns.\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\n=20\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\n=20\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\n=20\ngoing forward.\n\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\n\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\n=20\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\nAs=20\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\nes=20\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\n\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\n=20\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\n=20\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\nuse to=20\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\nee=20\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\n=20\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\n=20\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\n=20\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\n=20\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\n=20\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\noy to=20\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\ns=20\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\nre=20\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\nis=20\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\n=20\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\n=20\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\n=20\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\n=20\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\n\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\n\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\nsk=20\nissues.  We have identified three options:\n\nAmend AB1X\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\n=20\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\nred by=20\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\nto=20\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\n=20\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\n=20\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\n\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\nthrough Contract Language\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\nre=20\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\n=20\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\n=20\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\n\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\ncept=20\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\n=20\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\n=20\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\n=20\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\n=20\ncontract amendments.\n\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\n\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\n=20\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\nr=20\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\nl=20\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\n=20\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\nlikely. =20\n\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\n well=20\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\nn=20\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\n=20\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\no=20\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\nhe=20\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\nthis=20\nrequirement. =20\n\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\n=20\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\nre=20\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\n=20\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\nt=20\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\n=20\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\n\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\n=20\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\n=20\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\n=20\nshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\n\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\n=01,s=20\nElectricity Crisis\n\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\nl=20\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\n=20\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\n\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\n\nIncrease supply\nDecrease demand\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\n\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\n=20\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\n=20\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\n\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\nslation=20\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\nse=20\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\n=20\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\nrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\n=20\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\nir=20\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\n\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\n=20\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\n=20\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\nst=20\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\n\nBuy-down demand\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\nd=20\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\n more=20\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\nld=20\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\n=20\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\neal=20\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\n\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\n\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\n=20\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\n=20\nverification.\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\n=20\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\n\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\ne:\n\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\ncularly=20\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\n=20\nresources.\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\nin=20\nthe state.\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\nk=20\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\n=20\nresponding.=20\n\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\n=20\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\n=20\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\n=20\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\ns=20\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\n\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\ncle:=20\nSB27X\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\nre=20\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\n=20\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\n=20\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\ne=20\nprohibition against Direct Access.\n\nEnron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\n=20\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\nf=20\nWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\n=20\ncustomer migration. =20\n\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\n=20\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\nnt=20\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\nia=20\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\nin=20\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\n=20\nof utility load.\n\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\nvehicle:=20\nAB18X\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\n. =20\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\n=20\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\nia=20\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\ned=20\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\ne=20\nin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\nparticipate in that market.\n\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\n=20\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\n=20\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\nould=20\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\nd. =20\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\n=20\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\nAB=20\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\neceived=20\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\ne=20\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\n\n ","to":["jimbrulte@aol.com"],"bcc":[],"replyto":null,"date":"2001-02-16 10:07:00-08:00","folder":"all_documents","subject":"Information from Ken Lay at Enron"},{"sender":"rosalee.fleming@enron.com","recipients":["lisa.l.brown@us.pwcglobal.com"],"cc":[],"text":"Lisa, please attach your resume.

As a result oil prices pushed\nslightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at\n25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl\nas a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as\nfollows:\n\nAlgeria - 32,000\nIndonesia - 52,000\nIran - 146,000\nKuwait - 80,000\nLibya - 54,000\nNigeria - 82,000\nQatar - 26,000\nSaudi Arabia - 324,000\nUAE - 88,000\nVenezuela - 116,000\nTotal - 1,000,000\n\n\nENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\n(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\nexploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\nOffshore area.\nEnergy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\n(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy\nAfrica's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\nAndrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore\nwhich make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\nvery much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the\nmoment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum\nBulletin.\n\n\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\nLondon - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\nexploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,\ntransportation, and industry could account for more than half of the\npotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas\ntechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=\nd\npower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant\nemissions. And \"low-carbon energy systems,\" such as renewable energy, can\nalso make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the\nfinding that there is \"no single path to a low emission future.\"\n\nRead more:\nwww.unep.ch/ipcc/ <http://www.unep.ch/ipcc/>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBarriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations\n\nThere is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-\nefficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually\nseen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy\nresearch group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a\nseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden\ncosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from\noperating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of\nthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through\nimproved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=\nd\nin the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=\ne\ndevelopment of a broadly based energy service industry.\n\nRead more:\nwww.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html\n<http://www.sussex.ac.uk/spru/environment/research/barriers.html>\n\n--------------------------------\n\nState of the World Report\n\nFrom the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the\nmosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the\nWorld 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged\nnatural systems.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\nthan are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code\nis the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\nTexas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new\nstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\ng\nenergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\nserve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=\ne\nTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG\nstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=\ne\nProject and Alliance Associates.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlliance Associates Honored with Awards\n\nMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards\nCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the\nDepartment of Energy.

(NASDAQ: INTU\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\n> the board.\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among\n> the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\n> Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of\n> businesses.\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\n> Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.\n> Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an\n> ideal match for our future.\"\n> Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced\n> and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management\n> teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad\n> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,\n> \"Steve shares Intuit's values.

Pursuant to those\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area\non\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\n\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.\n\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and\nadvise\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before\nor\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\n\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\nto\nattend the dinner.\n\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\na\nboard member's home nearby.\n\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\nany questions you may have.

Juno is very interested in  working \nwith (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  \nindustry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  \npartnerships.\n?\nInformation about Juno is available at \"About Juno\" on Juno's Web site \nhttp://www.juno.com.?

Total net loss for 2001  was \nprojected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  \ncontinues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  \nancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  \nor?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  \nresources are \"more than adequate\" to get the business profitable.? The  \ncompany has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  \nflexibility.  \nThe company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  \nactive subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  \ntoday and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  \n2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  \nfees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  \nbetween $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription \nand  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the \nsoft  Internet advertising markets.  \nJuno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  \ncovering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  \nTime Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  \nMetricom (wireless).  \nThe company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  \nMobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be \nforthcoming.  \nThe company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  \ncompetitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  \npublicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  \nopportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  \ndomestically and internationally.?  \nThe Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's \nefforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing \ninitiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs \nof subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and \ncomputational chemistry firms.? \nhttp://www.juno.com/corp/news/supercomputer.html\n\n\n=============\nToby  Bryce\n(347) 200-0882\nbryce@juno.com\n=============\n?\nOn Wed, 14 Mar 2001 16:52:52 -0500 Toby Bryce <bryce@juno.com> writes:\n> Mr.  Lay,\n> \n> I am contacting you (per instructions of Rosalee) with a  director \n> opportunity with a NASDAQ-listed Internet media firm.?

Len Baker may feel that the\nlanguage on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the\nSEC should not only issue a \"concept release\" to solicit broad public\ncomments on a \"supplementary framework for reporting intangibles,\" but it\nshould create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this\napproach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also\nfeels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating\nwhat companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to\nwrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of\nyou will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you\nfeel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do\nstate them for the record.\n\n  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,\netc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you\nletting me know if you can sign-off on the report.

As discussed, he is to chair the first of\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\nThe panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\nSciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\n\nAs I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\nresponsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive\nissues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\nI would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\nkeep our files current.\n\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\ndocuments to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\nif you had any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\n\nIn addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\nduring our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also\nplanning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\ncoming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\nany events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\n\nAlso, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\nmight facilitate their logistics.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nJonathan Pershing\n\n________________________\nJonathan C.

Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at \nSmith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since \nreestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a \nproposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan \nportfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this \nmoney ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with \nSmith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about \n$235 million.)\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its \nquarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the \nCommittiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation \nto minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is \nlooking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be \nreached sometime in May.

I would greatly appreciate receiving from you\nany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the\nagenda.

The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a\nnominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.\n\nWhat makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a\nshareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff\nshareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on\nbehalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is\nclaiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that\nall damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff\ncan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\nDerivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\n\nThe Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\non your behalf.

This year's keynote sessio=\nn=20\nis entitled \"The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and  opportunity in the=\n=20\nelectronic energy marketplace\". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=\nld=20\nlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20\nresearch has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =\non=20\nthis subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=\n=20\nschedule.\n\n=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=\nnces=20\nbeing made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=\nnce=20\nwill be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20\nchance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=\nl=20\nbe partitioned into five areas:=20\n\n1) Information technology for risk management\n\n2) Information technology for pricing and trading\n\n3) Data techniques and strategies\n\n4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management\n\n5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace\n\nEach of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=\n=20\nby energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=\n a=20\ncopy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20\nexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=\n=20\nproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\n\nThis conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=\ne=20\nto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=\n=20\nfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=\n=20\nhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=\n=20\nme know; any help would be gratefully received.\n\nThis event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20\nManagement Magazine and our extensive database.

Totally unexpected & \nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good \nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, \nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific \nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \nmodify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \nfind another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \navoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \nthis.\"  \n\nTo date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \nEnron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \nand there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \nCindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was \ndecided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when \nthings go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented \nprofessional more time.  She writes:\n\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in \nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 \ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received \nanswers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without \nacknowledgment of any sort.\n\nI have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened \nto them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 \nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...\n\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There \nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & \ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from \nHR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line \nwith Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  \n\nCindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \nhonor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \nmention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to \nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not \nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I \nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  \"believing your own \nbaloney.\"  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but \"believing \nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.

Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual \nBeach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, \nraising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the \nfundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will \nbe used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n\nI have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel \nMcPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in \nthis cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but \nI want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.\n\nI am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  \nChecks are payable to MDA.\n\nFYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. \n\nThe event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks!

Also, that we if we find a church that is \nnot so amazing, he can decorate that as well. \nThe name of the photographer is Dennis Reggie and his number is 404- \n873-8088.  Linda Kessler has all the information on the florist, her number \nis 888 524 1326.\nMom is going to be responsible for the RSVP's for the wedding.

But, as you would expect, the market responded by \nproposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak \ndemand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, \nhas failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not \nderegulation.\n\nWhen San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, \nEnron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego \ncustomers from price volatility and provided prices below their current \nsummer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of \nEnron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded \nwhere regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers \nbecause of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside \nof the PX (i.e. the spot market).\n\nIn markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional \ngeneration.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  \nThose plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time \nfor the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market \nresponds.\n\nThe solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition \nnot reregulation.  Policy makers should:\n\nOpen the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it \nis needed.\n\nExpedite interconnection of new generation.\n\nExpedite siting of new facilities.\n\nGive customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side \nsolutions.\n\n\nAlso attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff \nDasovich of our San Francisco office.\n","to":["executive.committee@enron.com"],"bcc":["gavin.dillingham@enron.com","joseph.hirl@enron.com","jeannie.mandelker@enron.com","day@enron.com","mark.schroeder@enron.com","richard.shapiro@enron.com","james.steffes@enron.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-08-14 10:42:00-07:00","folder":"all_documents","subject":"Talking Points re \"reregulation\" in California"},{"sender":"maureen.mcvicker@enron.com","recipients":["kenneth.lay@enron.com","rosalee.fleming@enron.com","rosalee.fleming@enron.com"],"cc":["rosalee.fleming@enron.com"],"text":"Please see the attached memo.\n","to":["kenneth.lay@enron.com"],"bcc":["rosalee.fleming@enron.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-08-14 11:43:00-07:00","folder":"all_documents","subject":"CALL TO GRAMM"},{"sender":"sally.keepers@enron.com","recipients":["vermeil@ev1.net","nlay@worldnet.att.net","dherrold@enlineresources.com","lizard_ar@yahoo.com","beau@layfam.com","mrslinda@lplpi.com","kenneth.lay@enron.com","mrslinda@lplpi.com","kenneth.lay@enron.com"],"cc":["mrslinda@lplpi.com","kenneth.lay@enron.com"],"text":"Linda & Ken are beginning to make plans for the holiday and asked that I poll \neach of you re the following:\n\nWhere do you plan to spend Christmas eve and Christmas day?\n\nIf planning to come to Aspen, when arriving and departing?  # in your travel \nparty?  \n\nIf traveling commercially, please provide carrier and flight # information.\n\nPS -- I've heard back from Liz & Jose Luis - they are arriving Aspen 12/23, \ndeparting 12/30,\nNatalie, Mark, & Zach arrive 12/26, depart 1/2.\n\nRobyn, David, Beau - please respond ASAP.

Mr. Peters will help set the theme \nby discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. \nHamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.

We\ninvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\non Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\nevent.\n\nOur theme is \"2001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\nshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\ndeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\nenterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to\nclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\n\nI was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\nMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\nthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\no\nheart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the\nopportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\nvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include\ncomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\nguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\nmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\n\nThe IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\nd\nuniversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=\nu\nup-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure\nRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\nfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\ne\n(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\naddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\nRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\nand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\njoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\nConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\n\nFinally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\nsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\nwhich you helped to found.

Enron is mentioned but not interviewed so I didn't know\nif you would have access to a copy.\n\nTake care,\nMary Elizabeth\n\nLink to article:\n\nhttp://www.cvmag.com/contents/2000/0814/vod814.asp\n\nCut and paste:\nVideo on the Move\nDropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see\nvideo-on-demand in a whole new light\nBY SIMON APPLEBAUM\nAt VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does\nthe rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come\ninto play:\n* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators' best customers;\n* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream\ntransmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used\nto justify not deploying VOD;\n* the fallout from Time Warner's deal to merge with America Online --\nnamely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other\nconvergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services\n(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,\nor interactive TV.\nThus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition\nstaring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS\nreaches 13 million subs \"and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the\npain,\" says Diva president David Zucker. \"Every one of the eight largest\ncable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.\nThe big rollouts will start the second half of the year.\" If they come, they\nmay hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital\nsubscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed\nInternet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV\nthrough Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron\nBroadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a\nnumber of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint\nventure will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will\nbe in the driver's seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.\nBut right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker\nsuggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in\ntrial; most MSOs don't, even though they are deep in digital-service\nlaunches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a\nsystem's lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels\nthan NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system's headend,\nstore the programming and transmit it on addressable command from\nsubscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff\nfor mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion\ndollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch\nsenior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV\nforum in New York.\nWhere the Action Is\nYou need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening\naround the country, but you don't need many more. Here's the scorecard:\n * Diva - VOD's veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at\nleast 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.\n(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter\nCommunications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight\nCommunications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,\nInd.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media's Local Source interactive-TV\nservice. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los\nAngeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to\nspecial-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a\npop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.\nAvailable attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and\nother cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.\n * Time Warner - Cable's second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,\nfollowing a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the\nfirst Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this\nyear, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according\nto Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time\nWarner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.\n* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player\nthat includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity\nstakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast's suburban Baltimore system. That\nfollows DSL rollouts in U S West's Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an\nindependent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to\naccompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist's CD after\nwatching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce\nchoices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a \"stunning\"\nMSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.\n* In Demand - PPV's kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about\nVOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post\nearlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).\n* TVN - In Demand's closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of\nmid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical\nand marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this\nfall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with\ninteractive applications.\n * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially\non a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn't be absent\nfrom VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound\nCable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association\nconvention, and Seren put Demand's format through a 25-home trial in St.\nCloud, Minn. But at NCTA's show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted\nthat his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.\nKnology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while\nSeren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa\nCounty, Calif.\n* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has\ndeveloped download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve\nfeature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video's\npresident, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator\nbefore summer ends.\nUp ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures\nrunning both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at\nStreaming Media East in New York. Within VOD's own tech vendordom --\ncompanies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators\n-- there's growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How\nfast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,\nbelieves Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene\nwith digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  \"We're at the front\ndoor of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for\nthis market to happen,\" he says. \"The only thing holding the market back is\nthe ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level\nequal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million\ndigital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by\noperators becomes a no-brainer.\" AOL Time Warner will push operators into\ndeployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. \"The convergence of\nTime Warner's content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will\ndrive the content and availability of content for VOD,\" Pohl suggests.\n\"Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,\nviewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.\"\n\"You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the\nvendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,\"\nsays Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.\n\"The AOL-Time Warner merger helps.\"\nThe Naysayers\nBut many people don't buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they're supplying\nproduct to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They're in the game,\nbut Playboy TV president Jim English doesn't look for a breakout market\nuntil 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, \"you need so many per\nstate, so many per [sub universe],\" English reasons. \"The more subs on the\nline, the slower the traffic goes. It's still very expensive electronics.\nI'm not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this\nindustry didn't come out as advertised. How many years did it take for\ndigital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to\ninstalling high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable's agenda\npriority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one.\" For\nSusquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make\nit to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.\nAs big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among\nlarge MSOs, it's magnified several times over for owners the size of\nSusquehanna and Classic.  \"Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds\nof thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000\ncustomers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we\nservice, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?\"\nasks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. \"When you take into account the\nflexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content\navenues, there's a lot that's nascent and in development,\" responds Dan\nTemplain, Susquehanna's corporate marketing/programming director. \"The\ncontent and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that\nwe're willing to roll it out.\" Still, Templain's company is determined to do\na field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the\nend of next March. \"That's accelerated thinking from where we were six\nmonths ago.\" To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train\neveryone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the\npoint where the medium should be relabeled \"COD\" -- for content-on-demand.\nMovies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but\nnot far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and\nspecial-interest videos, children's fare, games, adult entertainment and a\nfew genres spun out of the imagination of others.  \"There may be\nlocalized-content opportunities,\" chirps In Demand's Jacobsen. \"Local\ntheater, high school football games with real community value.\" In a COD\nworld, \"you're not limited to video product,\" says TVN senior business\ndevelopment VP Jim Riley. \"Eventually, you download computer software so you\ncan view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That's where we're driving\nsome of our development energies.\" TVN's vehicle is Chromazone, involving\nCalifornia-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,\nIntertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. \"If MSOs\nmake the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,\ne-commerce and all sorts of interactivity,\" says Jonathan Taplan,\nIntertainer's president and CEO. \"That's the ultimate promise. If you think\nabout the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like\n$20 a sub per month, that's a damn good business.\" Diva, infused with $9\nmillion earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV\nand Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to\npursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators\nwill see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription\nvideo-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting\na substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T\nBroadband's newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne\nmerger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore's multiplex\nmovies. Here's the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for\nan extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,\nwith VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as\nmany times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will\ndo. \"We're using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform,\" Sie insists. \"Movies\nwill drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do\nsubscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand.\" Lately, Sie's SVOD\nadvocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the\ndirection of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite\nservices are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two\nyears at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year\ntimeframe other industry execs predict. \"You know and I know consumer demand\nfor digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of\ninstallation crews. DBS realized that and now they're ramping up,\" Sie\nbelieves. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is\navailable in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,\nthere may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.\nIndependent of audience demand, there's the specter of cannibalization,\nwhere on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. \"Here's\na way to enhance and optimize premium services,\" Nussrallah concludes. \"If\nyou get constant access to the programming, it's more customer-friendly, and\nsomething DBS can't provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience\nbuys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next\nopportunity window.\" Not so, Taplin figures. \"It would be cool to get all of\nThe Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies\non premium pay for more of those same movies, after they've had the chance\nto watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or\nunless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee\nmodel is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one\nfee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn't the right window.\" Sie\ndefends SVOD as an enhancement option. \"Would an operator launch digital\ncable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes\npay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same\nhere.\" Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.\nTVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic\nand Susquehanna are open to proposals. \"What John says is super. What does\nit cost me? I've got a stock market and bond market to work with,\" Belisle\nsays.\nStream Thinking\nSusquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD \"a work in progress platform.\" Others\nsay the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry\nexploitation. \"Spectacular\" may be the most accurate adjective for the\nassortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households\neverywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More\ndiverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same\ntech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new\noriginal content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites\nthemselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them\npoint to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,\nmore than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the\nmarket's obvious to them. In the end, that's the ticket, cable execs concur.\nBut for the near term, no. The broadcast quality's not there yet (although\ntech strides are happening), and there's considerable fear that producers\nwill use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as\nthe point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the\nindustry locks its fears away, nCube's Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting\n\"this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC.\" \"We're\nsleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,\"\nadds Diva's Zucker. \"But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in\nthe next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage\nof it.\" *\n\n <<...>>\nHOME </> | CURRENT ISSUE </contents/2000/0814/> | BACK ISSUES </contents/> |\nDATABASE </database/> | LINKS </links/> | ABOUT US </about_cv/>  All\ncontents , 2000 Cahners Business Information. <http://www.cahners.com> All\nrights reserved.

COMPAQ has also denied EBS \naccess to expertise and installations required for product refinement and \nimplementation.  (Based on the feedback I have received, I question whether \nCOMPAQ intends to honor the terms and conditions of its relationship with \nEBS).\nEFS only provides building services currently to a couple of Compaq's \ninstallations.  \nEES has been in discussions with COMPAQ for several months now.  Although we \nare progressing, it would appear that we are at an impasse on the language in \nthe contract necessary to support the transaction.\nOn the EnHome program, COMPAQ has generally been unresponsive to our \nquestions and concerns for clarification and/or additional information on \ntheir experience in operating this type of program.\nThe Widows 2000 Roll-out Contract literally has taken months to complete when \nit should have only been a matter of weeks.\n\nKen, based on what I am seeing day-to-day, I am concerned that COMPAQ has \nlost sight of the value of our total business and the value of a healthy, \nbidirectional relationship.\n\nTherefore, specifically given the unresponsiveness to our most recent \nrequests for clarification on the EnHome Program and our concerns regarding \nthere ability to operate a program of this magnitude, I have requested that \nwe reopen discussions with IBM and DELL.\n\nI will keep you apprised of future developments.\n\nGeorge Wasaff","to":["kenneth.lay@enron.com"],"bcc":["cindy.olson@enron.com","richard.causey@enron.com"],"replyto":null,"date":"2000-08-18 02:09:00-07:00","folder":"all_documents","subject":"Follow-up to Cindy Olson's Voice Mail Message Regarding Compaq's\r\n Involvement as a Potential Service Provider to Enron's EnHome Computer\r\n Employee Benefit Initiative"},{"sender":"corry.bentley@enron.com","recipients":["kenneth.lay@enron.com"],"cc":[],"text":"Here in my group, and all over Enron, I see people working hard while some \neven go above and beyond.
